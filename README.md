#Pac to the Future

1997 called. It wants its DHTML Pac-Man back.

***Coming to [DHTMLConf 2000](http://dhtmlconf.com/) at [JSFest Oakland](http://oakland.jsfest.com/), December 12th, 2014 at [The New Parkway Theater](http://thenewparkway.com/wp/).***

In 1997, on a mission to learn how to write DHTML, a 24-year-old web developer named David Furfero travelled down a dark tunnel of curiosity that ultimately led to a browser-based implementation of Pac-Man, built using JavaScript and `<layer>` elements. One of those design decisions proved to be a huge mistake. The other changed the course of Internet exploration forever.

Recently, during a hard-drive purge, his code was rediscovered.

* What other huge mistakes and anti-pattern fossils are buried deep inside this 17-year-old code base?

* What algorithmic gems and genius hacks will we unearth when we turn our spelunking headlamps upon these ancient scripts?

* What have we learned as a developer culture since our earliest days of view-sourcery?

* And, will I be able to get a version of Netscape 4 running long enough to demonstrate the game?

In *Pac to the Future*, we will travel back in time to code review the early experiments of a web alchemist to answer these questions and many others.*

\* Not that many.
